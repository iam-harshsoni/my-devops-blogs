## What Are Self-Hosted Runners?

A self-hosted runner is a server that you manage and configure to execute GitHub Actions workflows. Unlike GitHub-hosted runners that operate in the cloud, self-hosted runners give you complete control over the environment, allowing customization and optimization according to your specific needs.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Customization:** Install specific tools, dependencies, and configurations unique to your project.
    
2. **Performance:** Leverage dedicated resources for faster execution times.
    
3. **Cost Efficiency:** Use your existing infrastructure or cloud resources to save on costs.
    
4. **Flexibility:** Handle workloads that require unique hardware or software setups, such as GPU-enabled tasks.

## Why Use Self-Hosted Runners?

While GitHubâ€™s hosted runners work well for many use cases, self-hosted runners shine in the following scenarios:

* **High Demand:** When workflows demand more CPU, memory, or disk space than the shared runners can provide.
    
* **Specific Tools:** When you need pre-installed tools, libraries, or dependencies that arenâ€™t available in default runners.
    
* **Security & Compliance:** For workflows requiring private environments, such as on-premise servers.
    
* **Cost Control:** When running workflows extensively, hosting your runners can be more economical.

## Practical Setup: Self-Hosted Runner on AWS EC2

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to setting up a self-hosted runner on an AWS EC2 instance.

### **Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance**

1. **Launch EC2 Instance:**
    
    * Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.medium for general use).
        
    * Select an appropriate AMI (Amazon Machine Image) like Ubuntu Server.

2. **Configure Inbound and Outbound Rules:**
    
    * Allow SSH access (port 22) to connect to the instance.
        
    * Open necessary ports for your workflow (e.g., port 443 for HTTPS).

3. **Connect to Your Instance:**
    
    * Use SSH to log in to your instance.

Run all the commands one by one in your ec2 instance

### **Step 3: Update Your Workflow File**

Modify your workflow YAML file to use the self-hosted runner:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

---

### **Step 4: Run and Verify**

1. Commit and push your changes to trigger the workflow.
    
2. Monitor the workflow execution in the GitHub Actions tab.
    
3. Confirm that the job is executed successfully using the self-hosted runner.
