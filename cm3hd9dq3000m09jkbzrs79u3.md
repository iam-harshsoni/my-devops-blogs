In this blog, I explore three common methods of setting up passwordless authentication: using **SSH keys**, **SSH-copy-id**, and **password-less** configurations. Passwordless authentication is a secure, efficient way to access remote systems without entering passwords each time, enhancing both convenience and security. I‚Äôll walk through each method, breaking down the setup process for seamless, password-free logins.

I have created 3 EC2 instances on AWS and I will use my local machine as a control node to perform password-less authentication on all the instances

# Using SSH Keys

Lets try to perform passwordless authentication on ‚Äòmanage-node-1‚Äô using ssh-keys.

I have created private and public keys using this below command

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

it will create .ssh folder and that folder contains private and public key

Connect to ***manage-node-1*** from the AWS console. Copy the control node's public key and paste it into the ***authorized\_keys*** file on ***manage-node-1***.

Try to log in to ***manage-node-1*** without using a password or any keys.

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<public ip address>
```

# Using SSH-copy-id

Copy the key pair to a safe directory. We will use this key pair to perform passwordless authentication on manage-node-2.

Note: This keypair.pem should be the same one used during the creation of manage-node-2.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -f "-o Identityfile <path_of_keypair.pem>" [user@]hostname
```

Try to log in to ***manage-node-2*** without using a password or any keys.

# Using Password Configuration

Connect to ***manage-node-3 using* AWS Console.** Edit this file ‚Äò60-cloudimg-settings.conf‚Äù and update ‚ÄòPasswordAuthentication yes‚Äô

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731591045848/2dae3230-0a68-423d-b732-2a79b22b5109.png align="center")

Restart ssh process

```bash
sude systemctl restart ssh
```

Create a password for current user

```bash
sudo passwd ubuntu
New Pass:
Retype Pass:
```

Now, try to connect ***manage-node-3*** from control-node ( laptop ) using ssh-copy-id &lt;username@public ip&gt;

You need to enter the password the first time you connect to manage-node-3. After that, when you try to connect again, it won't ask for a password.

# Conclusion

Setting up passwordless authentication between control and managed nodes enhances both security and efficiency. This method simplifies node management, allowing you to automate tasks securely and focus on more complex DevOps operations.
