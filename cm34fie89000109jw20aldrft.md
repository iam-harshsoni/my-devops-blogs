### What is Git and why is it important?

**Git** is a distributed version control system that enables multiple developers to collaborate on a project at the same time without overwriting each other’s work. It tracks changes in source code throughout software development, making it easier to manage code versions, collaborate effectively, and handle updates efficiently.

**Importance of Git:**

* **Version Control:** Keeps track of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.
    
* **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.
    
* **Branching:** Allows you to work on different features or fixes in isolation.
    
* **Backup::** Acts as a backup of your codebase.
    

### What is the difference between Main Branch and Master Branch?

* Traditionally, **master** was the default branch name in Git repositories. However, many communities now use **main** as the default branch name to promote inclusivity and avoid language that could be seen as exclusionary.
    
    **Main Branch vs. Master Branch:**
    
    * **Main Branch**: The current default branch name in many new repositories.
        
    * **Master Branch**: The original default branch name used in older repositories.
        
    
    The traditional default branch name used in older repositories.
    

### **Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?**

* Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that leverages Git for version control and offers additional collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management.
    
    **Git:**
    
    * Command-line tool for managing local repositories.
        
    
    **GitHub:**
    
    * Hosting service for Git repositories.
        
    * Provides collaboration tools and user-friendly interfaces.
        

### How do you create a new repository on GitHub?

1. Go to [GitHub.](https://github.com/)
    
2. [Cli](https://github.com/)ck on the **+** [icon](https://github.com/) in the top right corner.
    
3. Select **New rep**[**ositor**](https://github.com/)**y** from the dropdown menu.
    
4. Enter a name f[or you](https://github.com/)r repository (e.g., "DevOps").
    
5. Click on **Creat**[**e repo**](https://github.com/)**sitory**.
    

### What is the difference between a local & remote repository? How to connect local to remote?

* Local Repository:
    
    * Stored on your local machine.
        
    * Contains your working directory and Git database.
        
* Remote Repository:
    
    * Hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub).
        
    * Allows collaboration with other developers.
        
* Connecting Local to Remote:
    
    1. Initialize a local repository: `git init`
        
    2. Add a remote: `git remote add origin <URL>`
