AWS offers an incredible suite of tools to streamline DevOps workflows. After diving deep into these services, I’m excited to share what I learned about each one and how it contributes to an efficient, automated infrastructure.

## **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**

The foundation for flexible, scalable servers ideal for any workload.

## **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**

A secure, isolated network for your resources, like having a private cloud neighborhood.

## **EBS (Elastic Block Store):**

Reliable storage attached to EC2, ensuring data sticks around through reboots.

## **S3 (Simple Storage Service):**

The ultimate storage locker, handling data, backups, and even hosting static websites.

## **IAM (Identity and Access Management):**

Centralized control over permissions, keeping resources secure.

## **CloudWatch:**

Real-time monitoring for apps, keeping an eye on system health and metrics.

## **Lambda:**

Event-driven serverless compute—automating tasks without maintaining servers.

## **Cloud Build Services:**

* **CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy:** Automates everything from building to deploying code, fast-tracking CI/CD.
    

## **AWS Config:**

Tracks changes in resources to meet compliance and ensure configurations stay on track.

## **Billing and Costing:**

Budget and track usage to keep costs manageable.

## **KMS (Key Management Service):**

Encrypts data across AWS services with easy key management.

## **CloudTrail:**

Logs activity for governance, compliance, and auditing.

## **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):**

Managed Kubernetes clusters for seamless container management.

## **ECS & Fargate:**

Docker container orchestration with serverless options, ideal for microservices.

## **ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana):**

The go-to for logging, monitoring, and data visualization.

Each service is a tool I can’t wait to apply, making DevOps faster, more secure, and scalable.

## Conclusion:

Learning these 15 essential AWS services has been transformative, equipping me with key DevOps skills for automation, security, and scalability. Big thanks to Abhishek Veeramala for guiding me through each step! Excited to apply this knowledge in real projects.
