### **Git Branching**

---

Branches are a core concept in Git that allow you to isolate development work without affecting other parts of your repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.

Branches let you develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

### **Git Revert and Reset**

---

Git reset and git revert are two commonly used commands that allow you to remove or edit changes youâ€™ve made in the code in previous commits. Both commands can be very useful in different scenarios.

### **Git Rebase and Merge**

---

**What Is Git Rebase?**

Git rebase is a command that lets users integrate changes from one branch to another, and the commit history is modified once the action is complete. Git rebase helps keep a clean project history.

**What Is Git Merge?**

Git merge is a command that allows developers to merge Git branches while keeping the logs of commits on branches intact. Even though merging and rebasing do similar things, they handle commit logs differently.
