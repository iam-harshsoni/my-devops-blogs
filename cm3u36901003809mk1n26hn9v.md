Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Today, Iâ€™ll show you how I created an AWS EC2 instance using **Terraform**. If you are new to this, donâ€™t worryâ€”I'll keep it simple and easy to follow. Letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€

---

### What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is a tool that helps you create and manage cloud resources like servers (EC2), storage, and more. Instead of clicking around in the AWS console, you write a file that tells Terraform what you want. Then, it creates everything for you.

---

### Step 1: Things You Need

Before starting, make sure you have these tools ready:

1. **Terraform** installed on your computer.
    
2. **AWS CLI** installed and set up with your AWS account credentials.
    

If you donâ€™t have them installed, you can find the installation guides here:

* [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials)
    
* [Install AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
    

---

### Step 2: Write the Configuration File

Create a file named `main.tf` and copy this code:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"  
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0dee22c13ea7a9a67"  
  instance_type = "t2.micro"  

  tags = {
    Name = "Example-demo"  
  }
}
```

Hereâ€™s what the code does:

* The **provider** block tells Terraform to use AWS and sets the region (I used ***ap-south-1***).
    
* The **resource** block creates an EC2 instance with the specified AMI (Amazon Machine Image) and instance type (***t2.micro***).
    
* The **tags** give a name to the instance so itâ€™s easy to identify.

### Step 3: Run Terraform Commands

After writing the file, open your terminal and run these commands:

1. **Initialize Terraform**
    
    ```bash
    terraform init  
    ```
    
    This command sets up Terraform and downloads the necessary plugins.
    
2. **Check the Plan**
    
    ```bash
    terraform plan  
    ```

    This shows what Terraform will create. Itâ€™s like a preview before making changes.
    
3. **Create the Instance**
    
    ```bash
    terraform apply  
    ```

    When you run this, Terraform will ask for confirmation. Type `yes` to continue.

### Step 4: EC2 Instance Created!

Thatâ€™s it! After running the ***terraform apply*** command, my EC2 instance was created successfully. ðŸŽ‰

Hereâ€™s what it looked like:

### Conclusion

Using Terraform makes creating cloud resources like EC2 instances super easy. You just write a file, run a few commands, and everything is ready.
