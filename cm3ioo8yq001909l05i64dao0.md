Configuration management is an essential part of modern IT infrastructure, and tools like **Ansible** make it easy to automate repetitive tasks, ensure consistency, and manage configurations efficiently. In this blog, I‚Äôll show you the steps to set up and use Ansible to manage a target server.

## **Step 1: Install Ansible on the Control Node**

To begin, install Ansible on your control node. In this case, I‚Äôm using a **Linux server** with the `apt` package manager.

### Commands to Install Ansible:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ansible
```

Once the installation is complete, verify it:

```bash
ansible --version
```

## **Step 2: Create a Target Server**

I created another **EC2 instance**, which will act as the **Target Server**. This is the server that Ansible will manage.

## **Step 3: Set Up Passwordless Authentication**

Passwordless SSH authentication ensures that the control node can connect to the target server securely and seamlessly.

* Copy the content of this newly generated public key into Target Server ‚Äòauthorized\_keys‚Äô and saved it
    
* Go back to Ansible-server and try to connect with Target server without any password and you will successfully be able to connect.

## **Step 4: Create a File on the Target Server Using Ansible**

To demonstrate Ansible‚Äôs power, let‚Äôs create a file on the target server from the control node.

* **Create an Inventory File**:  
    The inventory file lists all the target servers Ansible will manage. Create a file named `inventory` with the target server's IP address:
    
* **Run an Ad-hoc Command**:  
    Use the following command to create a file named `devopsclass` on the target server:
    

This command uses the `shell` module to execute a command on the target server.

```bash
ansible -i inventory -m ‚Äúshell‚Äù -a ‚Äútouch devopsclass‚Äù
```

## **Step 5: First Ansible Playbook**

Ansible playbooks allow you to define a series of tasks in a structured YAML file. Let‚Äôs write a simple playbook to install **Nginx** on the target server.

`first-playbook.yml`:

## **Step 6: Execute the Playbook**

Run the playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory first-playbook.yml
```

## **Step 7: Verify Nginx Installation**

After executing the playbook, check whether **Nginx** is installed on the target server:

## **Bonus: Debugging with Verbose Mode**

To get detailed logs and understand what‚Äôs happening internally, use the `-vvv` option:

```bash
bashCopy codeansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory first-playbook.yml
```

Verbose mode provides valuable insights for troubleshooting and debugging.
