Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Today, Iâ€™m sharing my latest hands-on project using **Terraform** to build infrastructure on **AWS**. If you're new to **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** or looking for a simple project idea, this step-by-step guide will help you get started.

Iâ€™ll explain how I created resources like VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, and even an S3 bucket to host objects. Along the way, Iâ€™ll share the challenges I faced and the lessons I learned to help you navigate similar issues.

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ’¡

## Project Overview

Hereâ€™s what I built using Terraform:

1. **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)
    
2. **Public Subnets** (Subnet1, Subnet2)
    
3. **Internet Gateway** for connectivity
    
4. **Route Table and Subnet Association** for network routing
    
5. **EC2 Instances** (Server 1 & Server 2)
    
6. **Target Group** for load balancing
    
7. **Security Group** for secure access
    
8. **S3 Bucket** for storage
    
9. **Objects in the S3 Bucket**
    
10. Accessing the application through the public site

### Step-by-Step Implementation

Output from Terraform:

Lets see how it looks like on AWS Console..

#### Step 1: Created a VPC

I started by creating a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** to host all the resources securely.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* CIDR Block: `10.0.0.0/16`
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732884053349/0d69c3a4-fd08-4d56-b645-de36d86f550f.png align="center")
    

---

#### Step 2: Created Subnets

I created **two public subnets** to deploy the EC2 instances. These subnets are designed to provide high availability.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* **Subnet1**: `10.0.1.0/24`
    
* **Subnet2**: `10.0.2.0/24`
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732884063026/2c6b2f36-3447-4288-9976-6f83ea8dbe9c.png align="center")
    

---

#### Step 3: Added an Internet Gateway

To allow public internet access to my resources, I attached an **Internet Gateway** to the VPC.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* Gateway type: **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
    
* Attached to: My custom VPC
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732884066672/eab81221-a366-435c-9275-9167bdb43871.png align="center")
    

---

#### Step 4: Set Up Route Table and Subnet Association

I created a **Route Table** to define how traffic flows in and out of my VPC. Then, I associated the public subnets with this route table.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* Added a route for `0.0.0.0/0` to the Internet Gateway
    
* Associated **Subnet1** and **Subnet2** with the Route Table
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732884070487/ea9f45d9-3b4e-485c-812d-48d34c3c30a2.png align="center")
    

---

#### Step 5: Launched EC2 Instances

I deployed **two EC2 instances** to simulate application servers. Each instance was placed in a separate subnet.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* **Instance 1 (Server 1):** t2.micro
    
* **Instance 2 (Server 2):** t2.micro
    
* Connected to the **public subnets**
    
* Added **key pair** for secure SSH access

---

#### Step 6: Configured Target Group & Load balancer

I created a **Target Group** to enable load balancing between my servers. This ensures even traffic distribution.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* Health checks: HTTP
    
* Instances added: **Server 1** and **Server 2**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732884081081/a3ad9102-8212-4a36-b83b-e07406714126.png align="center")

---

#### Step 7: Set Up a Security Group

To secure my instances and resources, I created a **Security Group** with the following rules:

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* Allowed inbound SSH traffic on port **22**
    
* Allowed HTTP traffic on port **80**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732884086056/11d6d4da-95d7-442a-b82c-05f2027d9734.png align="center")
    

---

#### Step 8: Created an S3 Bucket

I added an **Amazon S3 Bucket** for storage and uploaded some test objects.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Configurations:**

* Bucket name: `my-terraform-demo-bucket`
    
* Access: Public (for testing purposes)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1732884087930/f8992285-8805-499a-a685-612b83558523.png align="center")

### Challenges Faced and How I Solved Them

1. **IAM Role for S3 Access**
    
    * I had to create an **IAM role** to grant the EC2 instances full access to the S3 bucket. This allowed the EC2 instances to upload and retrieve objects from the bucket.
        
2. **Making S3 Bucket Public**
    
    * While applying a bucket policy to make the S3 bucket public, I encountered a persistent error. Initially, the setup worked fine for the first run, but re-running the configuration for new infrastructure caused the same error.
        
    * **Solution:** I used \*\*ACL settings
        

(Access Control Lists)\*\* to configure both **bucket-level** and **object-level** permissions. AWS recently updated its ACL settings to separate permissions for buckets and objects for security reasons.

3. **ACL Ownership Issue**
    
    * While setting ACLs, I faced another error:
        
        ```bash
        Error: uploading S3 Object (terraform-2.png) to Bucket (demo-my-24-buck): operation error S3: PutObject, https response error StatusCode: 400, ...
        api error AccessControlListNotSupported: The bucket does not allow ACLs
        ```
        
    * **Root Cause:** The bucket didnâ€™t support ACLs due to its ownership control settings.
        
    * **Solution:**  
        I realized that Terraform was trying to apply the object ACL settings before the bucketâ€™s ownership controls were fully propagated. To resolve this, I introduced **explicit dependencies** in my Terraform configuration, ensuring that the bucketâ€™s settings were fully applied before uploading objects.
        
        This fix worked, and I could successfully upload objects to the bucket! ðŸŽ‰

### Modularizing the Architecture

Initially, this project followed a **monolithic architecture**, with all resources defined in a single configuration file. To improve reusability, maintainability, and testability, I refactored the project into a **modular architecture**.

Hereâ€™s how I organized the modules:

1. **VPC Module**: Contains all the VPC-related resources (VPC, subnets, internet gateway, route table).
    
2. **EC2 Module**: Manages the EC2 instances, security groups, and related configurations.
    
3. **S3 Module**: Handles the S3 bucket and object configurations.
    

This modular approach allows me to:

* Reuse the same modules across multiple projects.
    
* Simplify debugging by isolating each component.
    
* Make testing easier by focusing on individual modules.

### Key Takeaways

Through this project, I learned:

* How to configure AWS resources using Terraform effectively.
    
* Troubleshooting and resolving issues related to IAM roles, S3 permissions, and ACL settings.
    
* The importance of modularizing infrastructure for better organization and scalability.

### Next Steps

I plan to enhance this project by integrating it with a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
