As part of my learning journey in **DevOps and cloud engineering**, I explored how to deploy a **Flask application** on an **AWS EC2 instance** using **Terraform**. In this blog, I'll share what I learned, how I structured the project, and the steps I took to bring it all together.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

---

## **What I Set Out to Achieve**

The goal was simple: deploy a Flask app on AWS while learning to create and manage resources like **VPCs**, **subnets**, and **EC2 instances** using Terraform. This hands-on exercise helped me deepen my understanding of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

Here‚Äôs the basic architecture I worked on:

1. A **VPC** with proper networking setup.
    
2. A **subnet**, **route table**, and **internet gateway** to ensure connectivity.
    
3. An **EC2 instance** to host the Flask app.

## **Setting Up with Terraform**

### **1\. Writing the** [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) File

I started by creating the [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) file, which defines all the AWS resources. The key components I added were:

* **VPC**: For an isolated network.
    
* **Subnet**: For placing the EC2 instance within the VPC.
    
* **Route Table**: To manage routing rules.
    
* **Internet Gateway**: For internet access.
    
* **EC2 Instance**: To deploy and run the Flask application.
    

Here‚Äôs what the configuration looked like:

---

### **2\. Executing Terraform Commands**

Once the configuration was ready, I executed the following commands:

* **Initialize Terraform**
    
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
    
    This set up my working directory and downloaded all required plugins.
    
* **Validate the Configuration**
    
    ```bash
    terraform validate
    ```
    
    I ran this to ensure there were no errors in my Terraform files.
    
* **Apply the Configuration**
    
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    This command created all the resources. I loved seeing everything get provisioned automatically‚Äîjust as defined in my file!

## **Resources I Created**

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the AWS resources I learned about and set up:

### **1\. VPC**

The **VPC** served as the foundation for networking.

---

### **2\. Subnet**

The **subnet** was created to ensure proper placement and connectivity of the EC2 instance within the VPC.

---

### **3\. Route Table**

I linked the **route table** with the subnet and added a rule for internet connectivity via the **internet gateway**.

---

### **4\. Internet Gateway**

The **internet gateway** allowed my EC2 instance to communicate with the internet.

---

### **5\. EC2 Instance**

This is where the magic happened! I configured an **Ubuntu EC2 instance** and used **file provisioners** to upload the Flask app ([`app.py`](http://app.py)) to the server.

---

## **Testing the Setup**

Once everything was set up, I wanted to ensure it worked as expected.

### **Connecting to the EC2 Instance**

Using SSH, I connected to the EC2 instance to verify the configurations:

```bash
ssh -i ‚Äú~/.ssh/id_rsa‚Äù ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
```

After connecting, I confirmed that the [`app.py`](http://app.py) file was correctly uploaded to the specified directory.

---

### **Accessing the Flask Application**

Finally, I accessed the Flask app using the **public IP** of the EC2 instance.

It felt great to see the application live and running!

---

## **Cleaning Up**

To avoid incurring any unnecessary costs, I destroyed all the resources using Terraform:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This command safely removed everything I had provisioned. Watching the resources disappear was a reminder of how powerful Terraform is.

---

## **What I Learned**

This hands-on experience was an exciting journey! Here are my key takeaways:

1. **Terraform makes IaC simple and efficient**: Writing a few lines of code to manage complex cloud infrastructure is incredible.
    
2. **Understanding AWS networking**: Setting up VPCs, subnets, and internet gateways gave me a deeper insight into AWS networking.
    
3. **Testing and debugging are crucial**: Verifying each resource and connection ensured everything worked seamlessly.
    

---

## **Final Thoughts**

Deploying a Flask app with Terraform was a rewarding experience. It taught me how to bring together different AWS services, structure IaC projects, and manage cloud resources efficiently.

If you‚Äôre on a similar learning journey, I highly recommend trying this out‚Äîit‚Äôs a fantastic way to gain hands-on experience!
