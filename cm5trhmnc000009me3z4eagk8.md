Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a game-changer for automating and managing cloud resources. Recently, I worked on a Terraform project to provision an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster following industry standards. Here's a quick walkthrough of the project, its structure, and how you can apply the same to your own cloud environments.

## Why Terraform and EKS?

Managing cloud resources manually is time-consuming and error-prone. With Terraform, you can write reusable and modular configurations that scale effortlessly. Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies running Kubernetes workloads in the cloud. Together, they create a powerful combination for deploying and managing infrastructure with ease.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```plaintext
Project_Terraform_eks/
â”œâ”€â”€ .terraform/                     # Terraform state and configuration directory
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/                        # Directory for Terraform modules
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_eks/                    # Module for creating the EKS cluster
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_eks_node_group/         # Module for managing EKS Node Groups
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_elastic_ip/             # Module for allocating Elastic IPs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_internetGW/             # Module for creating the Internet Gateway
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_natGW/                  # Module for creating NAT Gateways
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_route_table/            # Module for configuring Route Tables
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_route_table_association/ # Module for associating Route Tables
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_subnets/                # Module for creating public and private subnets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_vpc/                    # Module for creating the VPC
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf                         # Main Terraform configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.tf                     # Provider configuration (e.g., AWS)
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf                    # Input variables for the project
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf                      # Output values for the infrastructure
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform.tfvars                # Variable values specific to this deployment
â””â”€â”€ README.md                       # Documentation for the project
```

Each module focuses on a specific resource, making it easy to manage and scale the infrastructure.

## Resources Created

Hereâ€™s an overview of the resources provisioned in this project:

* **VPC** with public and private subnets.
    
* **Elastic IPs** for NAT Gateways.
    
* **NAT Gateways** to enable secure internet access for private subnets.
    
* **Route Tables** for network routing.
    
* **EKS Cluster** with multiple node groups to host workloads.
    

---

## Why Modularity Matters

Using modules ensures that each part of the infrastructure is reusable, easy to maintain, and scalable. For example:

* You can reuse the **VPC module** across multiple projects.
    
* Adding a new **node group** is as simple as updating a few variables in the EKS module.
